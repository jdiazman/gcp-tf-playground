# 🌐 GCP Terraform Playground 🚀

Welcome to my **GCP Terraform Playground**! This repository serves as a playground for my journey in improving my skillset in  **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, **Terraform**, and **DevOps** practices. Here, I explore infrastructure as code (IaC), CI/CD pipelines, testing strategies, and other essential skills for modern cloud engineering.

## 🛠️ About the Project

This repository is a hands-on learning space where I:
- Build and manage **GCP infrastructure** using **Terraform**.
- Implement **DevOps workflows** such as CI/CD pipelines.
- Explore **testing strategies** for infrastructure and pipelines.
- Enhance my skills in **cloud engineering** and **automation**.
